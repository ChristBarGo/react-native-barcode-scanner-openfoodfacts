## Introduction

This repository implements an React Native Expo application to scan product barcodes and search for them in openfoodfacts using its JSON API: https://openfoodfacts.github.io/api-documentation/. When receiving product data from openfoodfacts, the product is saved in a Firebase Realtime Database and then, the application displays the product information.

## App workflow

When the app starts, the barcode scanner screen loads and is ready to scan a product barcode. When moving the app closer to product a barcode, the app search for it in openfoodfacts and displays the product details screen. <br>
The app has two bottom tabs, the first one shows the barcode scanner screen and the second one displays the history of scanned products. That page shows a list of products that were previously scanned and if one of them is touched, the product details screen for that product is displayed.
